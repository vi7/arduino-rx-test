Arduino Receiver Test
=====================

433MHz/315MHz receiver test with the Arduino framework


Development
-----------

For Digispark ATTiny85 `TinyDebugSerial` overrides `Serial` and uses `PB3` pin as serial TX


TODO
----

TODO: see the list below:
- check manchester description
- scan real remote with arduino
- understand scanned packets structure - use TX example
- implement receiver part
